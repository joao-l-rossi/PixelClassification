# Pixel Art Classifier: A FastAI and Hugging Face Deployment

Welcome to the **Pixel Art Classifier**! This project uses FastAI to build a machine learning model capable of classifying pixel art images into two categories: **Character** and **Scenery**. The trained model is deployed using Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces for interactive use.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Pixel Art Classification
- Classifies images into two categories:
  - **Character**: Pixel art of characters.
  - **Scenery**: Pixel art of landscapes or environments.

### âš¡ Deployment
- The model is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** using **Gradio**, allowing anyone to upload pixel art images and get instant predictions.

### ðŸ“– Learn from the Notebook
- Includes a well-documented Jupyter notebook to guide you through:
  - Data collection and preprocessing.
  - Model training and evaluation.
  - Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
